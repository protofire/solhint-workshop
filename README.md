# solhint-workshop

1. The [`Box.sol`](Box.sol) contract has a problem. Can you spot it?
2. Write a plugin implementing a rule that detects this problem.
3. Link the plugin, add it to the configuration and run Solhint on the contract.
4. Fix the problem and check that Solhint doesn't emit a warning anymore.
